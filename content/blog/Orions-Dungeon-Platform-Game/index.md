# 1<sup>st</sup> project for WDI26 London

<br>
<p>Welcome to my first project for the WDI course in GA London. I decided to create a traditional roguelike game with pixel art graphics. I redrew most of the art by using <a href="https://make8bitart.com/">make8bitart</a>, and recorded most of the sounds at home.</p>

<p>I learned how to draw the levels by reading the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/15_game.html">chapter 15 of Eloquent Javascript</a>. Writing this game was a bit tricky in the beginning, once I got used to the logic it turned fairly simple as I had to repeat most of it for the different scenarios.</p>

<p>I'd say that the attacks of the enemies and the potions were the most challenging part of the creation of this game. I enjoyed a lot drawing most of the stuff and making it more personalized.</p>

### Instructions:

You need to get a key to be able to open the door:<br>

<div>
<img src="key.png" width="60" height="40">
<img src="door.png" width="60" height="75">
</div>

<p>Once you go through the door you'll go to the next level. Earn points by collecting the coins in every level. Low on health? Don't worry, just drink a health potion or it'll be restored when you pass the level. You will find some enemies and also the following potions throughout the levels:</p>

### Potions:

<p>
The health potion:
<br>

<p>If you get the health potion your health will be restored by 40pts.</p>

<p>
The strong potion:
<br>

<p> If you get the strong potion your attacks will be way stronger for 20 seconds.</p>

## Extra work:

### Designing the levels:

I chose to design each level because if it was randomized it might've trap key objects such as the key or enemies, and I would like to provide the user the best experience for the game.

I used Google Sheets to help me with this task as I could set some formatting rules with colors corresponding to the letters that would better help me visualize the level.
